# Guess My Number!

Guess My Number is a game that prompts the user to guess THE number. It generates a random number between 1 and 20 
and the user can input their guess until their score turns 0. The game mechanincs use the DOM structure to connect
all the variables and elements. A fun silly little game to learn JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 

## Languages and Structure 
* `HTML`: `index.html` The main HTML file that structures the game's elements.
* `CSS`: `style.css` The CSS file that styles the appearance of the game.
* `JavaScript`: `script.js` The JavaScript file that contains the game's logic and functionality.

## Getting Started

To play the game locally on your computer, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository using Git.**
    * Run the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/EsaZhu/Guess-My-Number.git
        ```
    * This command will create a new folder named `Guess-My-Number` in your current directory and download all the files from the GitHub repository into it.

2.  **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.**

    * Once the cloning is complete, navigate into the newly created `Guess-My-Number` folder in your file explorer.
    * Double-click on the `index.html` file. This will open the game in your default web browser.

2.  You will see a number guessing game interface.
3.  Enter your guess in the input field.
4.  Click the "Check!" button to submit your guess.
